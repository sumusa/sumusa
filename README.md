<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sumayyah.</h1>
<h3 align="center">Aspiring Full Stack Developer | Security+ Certified</h3>

I'm a physiotherapy professional with a passion for technology and a drive to become a skilled full stack developer. Currently enrolled in the Get Coding program, I'm immersing myself in the world of web development, learning JavaScript and gearing up to explore frameworks like React, Express.js, and Node.js.

With certifications in Security+ and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, I bring a unique blend of healthcare expertise and tech knowledge to my coding journey. My goal is to become a well-rounded full stack developer, adept at building innovative digital solutions that make a positive impact.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, staying active, and connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts.
