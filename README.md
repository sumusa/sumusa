## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist based in Canada who is passionate about using data to improve health outcomes. Utilizing my physiotherapy background, I assist health research initiatives in analyzing and interpreting structured and unstructured data in order to develop data-driven solutions. I'm currently using machine learning in R to improve the accuracy of accelerometers and wearable devices in identifying physical activity. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me at a martial arts class or out for a walk in the park.
