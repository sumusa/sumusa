## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist based in Canada, an insatiable learner and data-driven problem-solver, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and uncovering hidden insights. As a data analytics professional, I bring a unique combination of technical skills and creative thinking to discover patterns and trends in data. Additionally, my passion for cybersecurity has given me a deep understanding of the importance of protecting sensitive information and staying ahead of emerging cyber threats. 

Whether analyzing data, exploring new technologies or keeping up with the latest in cybersecurity, I always seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me at a martial arts class or out for a walk in the park.


### Let's connect and see what we can achieve together!

## Projects 

### Settlement Support Tool for New Immigrants to Canada â€¢ [Project Summary Datafolio](https://c1-connect.com/profile/sumayyah-musa/projects/8907d5cf-5ddf-447d-9852-3dadd6286685) â€¢ [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sumayyah.musa/viz/Team6DS4A/Overview)

This project was carried out a sa requirement for the completion of my recent data science fellowship with Correlation One. I worked effectively with five individuals to build an interactive dashboard on Tableau for prospective immigrants to Canada to learn about the financial and cultural aspects of the province they are considering moving to.


### Physical Activity Behaviours of Older Adults â€¢ [R Notebook](https://github.com/sumusa/quantitative-research-methods/blob/master/regression.md)

This project examines the relationship between exercise barriers, motivation to exercise, exercise self-efficacy and the level of participation in leisure physical activity of older adults in Canada. It also uses these variables to predict the number of times an older adult would participate in physical activity for more than 15 minutes in a given week. The final regression model's F-ratio was 8.2.


### Effects of guided imagery, yoga and placebo on Stress â€¢ [R Notebook](https://github.com/sumusa/quantitative-research-methods/blob/master/anova.md)
The project's goal was to examine the effects of placebo, guided imagery and yoga on the stress level of individuals. The participants were divided into three groups and received either of the three interventions - placebo, guided imagery or yoga for six months, after which their stress level was measured and given a score. There was a total of 30 participants, 10 in each group.
The ANOVA analysis showed that yoga was the most beneficial form of reducing stress levels. Participants in the placebo group had the highest stress scores, while those in the yoga group had the lowest stress scores. The difference between yoga and guided imagery was not statistically significant, even though it was clinically significant.
