## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist based in Canada who is passionate about using data to improve health outcomes. Utilizing my physiotherapy background, I assist health research initiatives in analyzing and interpreting structured and unstructured data in order to develop data-driven solutions. 

I'm currently using machine learning in R to improve the accuracy of accelerometers and wearable devices in identifying physical activity. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me at a martial arts class or out for a walk in the park.

## Projects 

### Physical Activity Behaviours of Older Adults â€¢ [R Notebook](https://github.com/sumusa/quantitative-research-methods/blob/master/regression.md)

This project examines the relationship between exercise barriers, motivation to exercise, exercise self-efficacy and the level of participation in leisure physical activity of older adults in Canada. It also uses these variables to predict the number of times an older adult would participate in physical activity for more than 15 minutes in a given week. The final regression model's F-ratio was 8.2.


### Effects of guided imagery, yoga and placebo on Stress â€¢ [R Notebook](https://github.com/sumusa/quantitative-research-methods/blob/master/anova.md)
The project's goal was to examine the effects of placebo, guided imagery and yoga on the stress level of individuals. The participants were divided into three groups and received either of the three interventions - placebo, guided imagery or yoga for six months, after which their stress level was measured and given a score. There was a total of 30 participants, 10 in each group.
The ANOVA analysis showed that yoga was the most beneficial form of reducing stress levels. Participants in the placebo group had the highest stress scores, while those in the yoga group had the lowest stress scores. The difference between yoga and guided imagery was not statistically significant, even though it was clinically significant.
