## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist based in Canada who is passionate about using data to improve health outcomes. Utilizing my physiotherapy background, I assist health research initiatives in analyzing and interpreting structured and unstructured data in order to develop data-driven solutions. 

I'm currently using machine learning in R to improve the accuracy of accelerometers and wearable devices in identifying physical activity. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me at a martial arts class or out for a walk in the park.

## Projects 

#### [Physical Activity Behaviours of Older Adults]() â€¢ [R Notebook]()

This project examines the relationship between exercise barriers, motivation to exercise, exercise self-efficacy and the level of participation in leisure physical activity of older adults in Canada. It also uses these variables to predict the number of times an older adult would participate in physical activity for more than 15 minutes in a given week. The final regression model's RMSE was 7.
